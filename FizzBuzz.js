    Task 2 - FizzBuzz

    Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. 
    For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

    When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 
    (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

    else if (num % 5 == 0) console.log('Buzz');
